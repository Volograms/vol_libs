**A modular C/C++ library suite for loading, processing, and playing volumetric video (volograms) across native, web, and game engine platforms.**  
Easily extract mesh, texture, and audio data from vologram files for use in custom players, converters, or real-time applications.

The libraries here are designed to be used in native plugins for Unity, Unreal and web pages, and can also be used to drive any custom vologram player or converter software. This will give you frame-by-frame triangulated mesh data, with images for the texture, that can be used with any API.

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

### Try the Web Demo (Coming Soon)

A live web demo will be available soon!  
You'll be able to load and play vologram files directly in your browser.

#### Run the Web Demo Locally

**Option 1: Using PowerShell (Windows only)**
```powershell
# From the project root or wasm directory
.\serve.ps1
# Then open http://localhost:8000/examples/05_vol_player_wasm/index_opfs.html in your browser
```

**Option 2: Using http-server (Cross-platform, requires Node.js)**
```sh
npm install -g http-server
http-server
# Then open http://localhost:8080/examples/05_vol_player_wasm/index_three.html in your browser
```

<!--
Once available, you'll be able to try it here:
[Live Demo](https://<username>.github.io/<repo>/)
-->

<!-- *vol_geom used to load a simple Vologram and render it in OpenGL.* -->

## Installation

* Clone this repository.
* (Not required for web) Set up FFmpeg development libraries:
    * For Windows these can be found under the `thirdparty/ffmpeg_lgpl_free/` sub-directory, and you do not need to do anything.
    * On Ubuntu `sudo apt-get install build-essential clang libavcodec-dev libavdevice-dev libavformat-dev libavutil-dev libswscale-dev`.
    * On macOS `brew install ffmpeg`.
* (Optionally) install GLFW3 library if you wish to build OpenGL example programs:
    * For Windows this can be found under `thirdparty/glfw/` and you won't need to do anything.
    * On Ubuntu `sudo apt-get install libglfw3-dev`.
    * On macOS `brew install glfw`.
* Compile and run the test programs to check you have everything set up. These just produce text output.
```
make test_programs
cd tests/
./geom_test.bin
./av_test.bin
```

### Usage

* Volograms libraries are designed to be dropped directly into a C/C++ project, or may be compiled as a static or shared library, or as web assembly (WASM).
* To play volograms that use external WebM or MP4 video textures you need to use vol_av. This links against the FFmpeg dynamic libraries. _Web players do not use vol_av or FFmpeg_.
* `#include vol_av.h` or `#include vol_geom.h` and call interface functions from those headers.
* Library functions are documented in the header files.
* You can also generate API documentation using Doxygen. To do so install Doxygen, and invoke `doxygen` from the main directory of the repository.

### Example Programs

* `examples/` contains *code examples* for how you might invoke the libraries in your projects to render volograms.
* See the table below for what each example is and how to use it.
* For a visual output example try *vol_geom_av_opengl* to load a Vologram you have captured with Volu and exported to the desktop.

To build optional example programs (requires GLFW3) with Clang:

```
make example_programs
cd examples/
`./vol_geom_av_opengl.bin PATH_TO_MY/header.vols PATH_TO_MY/sequence_0.vols PATH_TO_MY/texture_2048_h264.mp4`
```
To run web examples start an https server ([http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server)) inside the root folder or use `serve.ps1` (Windows only but needed for the OPFS example). For example:
```
// create a certificate 
openssl req -newkey rsa:2048 -new -nodes -x509 -days 3650 -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem

// run https server
http-server -S -C cert.pem

// Open in web browser https://127.0.0.1:8080/examples/05_vol_player_wasm/index_three.html
```

### Troubleshooting

Homebrew on M1 Macs may require environment variables to be set: 

```
export CPATH=/opt/homebrew/include
export LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/homebrew/lib
```

## Tests and Fuzzing

* Typical unit test programs for each library are found under `tests/`.
* These are built using `make`, or `make test_programs`.
* Tests can be run manually from their compiled binaries.

* Fuzzing uses the same test programs, but compiled with [AFL](https://github.com/google/AFL).
* This only runs in a Linux environment (or eg [WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10) in Windows).
* To run the fuzzer first install AFL `apt install afl`.
* And then run bash scripts found under `fuzzing/` to execute each test separately.
* Fuzzing can take some hours to complete, but can be interrupted with CTRL+C when several unique crashes are found.
* Generated files that caused crashes are found in the `..._outputs/crashes/` subdirectory for each test.
* These should be run in the regular test program, and a debugger may be used to find and fix the crash.
* Then do another iteration of fuzzing after deleting the fuzzing output directory until no more crashes are found.
